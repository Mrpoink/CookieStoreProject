Have you ever wanted to run a cookie/bakery shop? Do you need a good template for a user interface to snag data from an
XML file then I have you covered!! In this package contains a JavaScript project designed for that purpose. In this
example we are using a set of Cookies from a menu, where the employee would read the menu with different options
and help the customer make an order. This also contains extra methods in the Register class so you can get a feel
for how to work it and what you can do. Anyways thank you!!
